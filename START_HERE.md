## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with Airtable** even if you're technical
   - Fastest way to publish
   - Easy to migrate to Sanity later

2. **Keep .env.local local**
   - Never commit API keys to GitHub
   - It's already in .gitignore

3. **Test locally first**
   - Make changes with `npm run dev`
   - Only push when happy

4. **Use environment variables**
   - For Vercel: Settings → Environment Variables
   - Matches your .env.local

5. **Automatic deployments are your friend**
   - Every `git push` rebuilds your site
   - With CMS: Instant updates!
